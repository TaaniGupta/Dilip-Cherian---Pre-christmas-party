# Dilip-Cherian---Pre-christmas-party
Dilip Cherian is one of the most prominent personality in PR industry. He had arranged a pre-christmas lunch party on 14 Dec, 2013. Dilip and Devi Cherian's annual pre-Christmas lunch had all the cheer and chatter that one expects from this must-attend bash.The party, themed red, saw many guests sporting stoles, scarves, bags and shoes of the colour. Dilip wore bright red pants, a stark contrast from his subtle red shoes from last year. One of the main attractions of the afternoon was the food, and the Cherians made sure their guests had multiple helpings of everything.
